# SystemScan plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki)

Plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki) that helps
me with my completionist/OCD of wanting to FSS scan every system I visit.

Additionally it also lists the bodies that are worth mapping, ie ammonia-,
water-, and earth-like world and the terraformable worlds.

## Installation

 1. Clone this repository or download and extract the [repository zip archive](https://github.com/pwerken/EDMC_SystemScan/archive/main.zip)
	in your EDMC plugin directory.
 2. Then (re)start EDMC.

## Usage

When entering the system this plugin will display a red 'Discovery Scan'
notice.  After honking it will change to a orange 'Full Spectrum Scan'.
When that is also completed the interesting bodies will be listed.

On entering a system this plugin also queries [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/)
for all the bodies.  This is so the interesting bodies can be listed in the
case where the 'Discovery Scan' reports that FSS is alread complete.
